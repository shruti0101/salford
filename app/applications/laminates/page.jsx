          High-quality titanium dioxide (TiO₂) plays a vital role in laminate
          flooring and furniture production. It brings brilliance, color
          stability, and surface smoothness to materials used in high- and
          low-pressure décor papers, decorative foils, and printed applications.

          Salford High-Quality TiO₂ in Production
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Inconsistent TiO₂ can lead to poor retention, color inconsistency, and
          reduced paper strength. <strong>Salford</strong> titanium dioxide is
          engineered with precision to ensure consistent quality, outstanding
          dispersion, and reliable performance throughout the production
          process.

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Achieving consistent color from reel to reel prevents costly downtime
          and improves profitability. With <strong>Salford TiO₂</strong>,
          manufacturers can maintain uniform color quality and predictable
          output across every production batch.

          Enhanced Appearance and Light Stability
        </h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          <strong>Salford TiO₂</strong> pigments deliver vibrant, blue-white
          undertones that enhance image clarity and pattern detail. They protect
          decorative surfaces from yellowing or fading due to UV and light
          exposure, ensuring long-lasting visual appeal.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Improved Paper Strength</h4>
        <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
          Consistent pigment quality from <strong>Salford</strong> allows
          producers to use lighter base paper without compromising strength.
          This leads to greater production efficiency and improved margins per
          ton of material.

          Applications within Laminate Manufacturing
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Décor papers—both high- and low-pressure—are essential for uni-color
          and print-based laminate applications. They demand superior quality
          and consistency, as printing base papers are used in several stages of
          laminate manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Decorative foils, an intermediate laminate material, are typically
          used for glue-on applications and require reliable performance under
          light pressure (1–2 bar), ensuring aesthetic appeal and long-lasting
          surface quality.
